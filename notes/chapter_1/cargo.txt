----- Cargo -----

- Rust's build system and package manager (similar to NPM).

- Can be used to created new projects using 'new' command.

- Version and dependency information can be found in the .toml file created
by 'cargo new' (similar to package.json).

- Cargo projects can be compiled using 'cargo build' which creates an executable in 
the target directory.

- A cargo project can be built and run using 'cargo run'. 

- To check our Rust code, we can use the command 'cargo check'. This command checks your code
to make sure it compiles. Often times, 'check' is faster than 'build'.

- When a cargo project is ready for release, we can use the 'cargo build --release' command
to compile the project with optimizations. These optimizations make your Rust code run faster,
however, it takes a longer time to compile.
