--- Traits ---

- A trait is a flag for the Rust compiler that tells it a particular type has
  some specific functionality and can be shared with other types. 

- Traits can be used to abstract shared behavior and use trait bounds to
  specify that a generic can be any type that has certain behavior. 

- A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Trait
  definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of
  behvarios that can accomplish some purpose.  

- Ex 1) Let’s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and amounts of text:
  a NewsArticle struct that holds a news story filed in a particular location and
  a Tweet that can have at most 280 characters along with metadata that indicates
  whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply to another tweet.

- We want to make a media aggregator library that can display summaries of data
  that might be stored in a NewsArticle or Tweet instance:

	pub trait Summary {
		fn summarize(&self) -> String;
	}

- Here we've declared the trait Summary, inside the curly brackets we clare
  the method signature that describes the behaviors of the types that implment
  this trait.

- After the method signature we end the definition with a semicolon. Each type
  implementing this trait must provide its own custom body for the method. The
  compiler will make sure that any type that has the summary trait will have the
  method summarize with this signature exactly!

- Traits can have multiple methods in their definition, the signatures are
  listed one per line and each line ends in a semicolon.

- After defining our trait, we must implement it on some type(s). Consider the
  following code based on Ex 1:

	pub struct NewsArticle {
		pub headline: String,
		pub location: String,
		pub author: String,
		pub content: String,
	}

	impl Summary for NewsArticle {
		fn summarize(&self) -> String {
			format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
		}
	}

	pub struct Tweet {
		pub username: String,
		pub content: String,
		pub reply: bool,
		pub retweet: bool,
	}

	impl Summary for Tweet {
		fn summarize(&self) -> String {
			format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
		}
	}

- In this example we have defined our trait and our types in the same lib.rs
  file, so they're all in the same scope.  

- Let's say that our trait is defined in a crate called aggregator, and someon
  else wants to use our craten to implement the Summary trait on a struct
  defined within their library's scope. First, the person using our crate would
  have to bring it into scope through the 'use' syntax:

	use aggregator::Summary;

- This would enable the user to implement summary for their type. The Summary
  trait would need to be public for another crate to implment it.

*** Note: We can only implement traits on a type if either the trait or the type is local to our crate!

- This means that we can implement std lib traits like Display on custom types
  like Tweet as part our aggregator crate because Tweet is local to our crate.
  Likewise we can implment the Summary trait on a type defined in the std lib
  like Vec<T> in our aggregator crate because Summary is local to our crate!

- We can't implement the Display trait on a Vec<T> within our aggregator crate
  because Display and Vec<T> are defined in the std lib and are not local to
  our aggregator crate.

- This restriction is part of a property of programs called coherence. More
  specifically, the orphan rule. Without this rule, two crates could implement
  the same same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn't know which
  implementation to use.

--- Default implementations ---  

- We can specify some default implementation for our traits methods by
  defining the method signature and body:  

	pub trait Summary {
		fn summarize(&self) -> String {
			String::from("(Read more...)")
		}
	}

- To use a default implementation of a trait on one of our types, we specify an
  empty impl block:

	impl Summary for NewsArticle {}

- Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if
  those methods do not have a default implementation:

	pub trait Summary {
		fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

		fn summarize(&self) -> String {
			format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
		}
	}

- To use this version of summar we only need to provide an implementation for
  summarize_author:

	impl Summary for Tweet {
		fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
			format!("@{}", self.username)
		}
	} 

- We can now call summarize on instances of Tweet and the default
  implementation of summarize will call the definition of summarize_author.
  Because we've implemented the summarize_author method, the Summary trait has
  gived us the behavior of the summarize method without having to write any more
  code: 

	let tweet = Tweet {
		username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
		content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
		reply: false,
		retweet: false,
	};

	println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
	
- This code prints: "1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks..."

--- Traits as paramters --- 

- We can use traits to define functions that accept many types. 

- For example, we can define a notify function that calls the summarize method
  on an 'item' parameter which is some type that implements the Summary trait:

	pub fn notify(item: impl Summary) {
		println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
	} 

- Instead of a concrete type for the item parameter, we specify the impl
 keyword and trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements the
 specified trait.   

- We can pass in any instance of NewsArticle or Tweet and we can use any
  methods that come from the summary trait on item. 

--- Trait bound syntax --- 

- The impl Trait syntax from the previous section is actually syntactic sugar
  for a longer form called a trait bound:

	pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: T) {
		println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
	}

- This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section. Whil
  this form is more verbose than using impl Trait, it allow us to express complex
  definitions clearly:  

	pub fn notify(item1: impl Summary, item2: impl Summary)  <===> pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: T, item2: T) 

- Although these are similar, implt Summary allows item1 and item2 to have
  different types. If we wanted to force both parameters to be of the same type,
  we would have to use a trait bound.

- We can use a special syntax to specify more than one trait bound:

	pub fn notify(item: impl Summary + Display) {

- Now the function notify will accept any type that implements BOTH Summary
  AND Display!

- We can use this syntax on generic  trait bounds as well: 

	pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: T) {

- Using too many trait bounds has its downsides, each generic has its own
  trait bounds, so functions with multiple generics will have very verbose
  signatures making them hard to read. For this reason, rust has a special syntax
  for sepcifying trait bounds:   

	fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: T, u: U) -> i32 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	fn some_function<T, U>(t: T, u: U) -> i32
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug

--- Returning types that implement traits ---

- We can use the impl Trait syntax in a function signature to indicate the
  return value is some type that implements a trait:  	

	fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
		Tweet {
			username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
			content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
			reply: false,
			retweet: false,
		}
	}

- By using impl Summary for the return type, we're returning some type that
  implements summary without naming the concrete type. In this case the funciton
  returns_summarizable returns a Tweet but the code calling this function does
  not know that. 

*** Note: You can only use the impl Trait syntax if you're returning a single type!

--- Largest function rewritten ---

- Lets take a look at the error that prevented our largest function from
  compiling:

	error[E0369]: binary operation `>` cannot be applied to type `T`
	 --> src/main.rs:5:12
	  |
	5 |         if item > largest {
	  |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	  |
	  = note: an implementation of `std::cmp::PartialOrd` might be missing for `T`

- In the body of our largest function we want to compare two values of Type T
  using the '>' opeartor. Because that opeartor is defined as the default
  method on the std lib trait std::cmp::PartialOrd, we need to sepcify this trait
  bound for T so the largest function can work on slices of any type that
  implement this trait. We don't need to bring PartialOrd into scope because it
  is included in the prelude: 

	fn largest<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> T {

- Now if we try to compile our code again we will run into the following errors:

	error[E0508]: cannot move out of type `[T]`, a non-copy slice
	 --> src/main.rs:2:23
	  |
	2 |     let mut largest = list[0];
	  |                       ^^^^^^^
	  |                       |
	  |                       cannot move out of here
	  |                       help: consider using a reference instead: `&list[0]`

	error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
	 --> src/main.rs:4:9
	  |
	4 |     for &item in list.iter() {
	  |         ^----
	  |         ||
	  |         |hint: to prevent move, use `ref item` or `ref mut item`
	  |         cannot move out of borrowed content

- The key error here is "cannot move out of type [T], a non-copy slice". In
  our non generic versions of the largest funcion, we were trying to find the
  largest values in i32 or char types. These types implement a Trait called
  'Copy', which means that they have a known size that can be stored on the
  stack. 

- Making the list function generic caused the list paramter to include types
  that do not implement the Copy trait. We wouldnt be able to move that value
  out of list[0] and into the largest variable. To fix the error above we can
  add the Copy trait to our trait bound as follows:

	fn largest<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(list: &[T]) -> T {
		let mut largest = list[0];

		for &item in list.iter() {
			if item > largest {
				largest = item;
			}
		}

		largest
	}

	fn main() {
		let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

		let result = largest(&number_list);
		println!("The largest number is {}", result);

		let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

		let result = largest(&char_list);
		println!("The largest char is {}", result);
	} 

- If we don't want to restrict the largest function to types that implement
  Copy, we could specify that T has the bound Clone instead of Copy. Then we
  would clone each value in the slice, potentially making more heap allocations
  in the case of data types like String. This can be slower if we're working with
  large amounts of data. 

- Another way to implement the largest function is to return a refernce to a T
  value. If we change the return Type to &T instead of T, we wouldn't need the
  Clone or Copy traits and we could avoid heap allocations! 
