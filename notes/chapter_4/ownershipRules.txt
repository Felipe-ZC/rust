--- Ownership Rules ---

1) Each value in Rust has a variable thats called its OWNER.
2) There can only be one owner at a time.
3) When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped. 

--- Variable Scope --- 

Ex: let s = "hello";

- The variable 's' refers to a string literal, the value of the string is hardcoded into the program.

- String literals are convenient, but aren't suitable for every text-based situation. String literals are immutable and we might not know what the value is when writing our program (taking input from user). 

- Rust features a type known as 'String' which is allocated on the heap and as such is able to store a large amount of text that is unknown at compile time. 

- Ex: let s = String::from("hello");

- The double colon ('::') is an operator that allows use to namespace this particular 'from' function under the String type rather than using some sort of name. This kind of String can be mutated:

- Ex 
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s.push_str("world"); // Appends a string literal to a String

- When a String goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function to free the memory occupied by the String. This function is called drop, which is called automatically when the var goes out of scope. 

--- Memory and Allocation ---

- So why can String types be mutated but not string literals? The is due to the way the two types handle memory. 

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

- A String object is made up of three different parts:

1) Pointer to the location in memory that holds the contents of the string
2) Length: Quantitiy of memory, in bytes, the contents of the String is currently using.
3) Capacity: The total amount of memory, in bytes, that the String has received from the OS.

- ^ This group of data is sotred on the stack, the contents of string is stored on the heap. 

- When we asign s1 to s2, only the stack data is copied, meaning the pointer, length and capacity are copied but not the contents of string.    

- Earlier we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the drop function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. There is a problem if both variables are pointing to the same memory location, when they go out of scope they will try to free the same memory. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption!

- To ensure memory safety, Rust performs a 'move'. Instead of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust no longer considers s1 to be valid and therefore Rust doesnt need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope.

--- Clone ---

- If we do want to perform a deep copy of the heap data of a String, not just the stack data, we can use the clone method:

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

--- Stack only data --- 

let x = 5;
let y = x;

- If we were to print the values of the variables defined above, you would notice that x is still valid and wasn't moved to y. Which means data was copied without a call to clone or a move. 

- The reason is that types whose size is known at compile, like integers, are stored entirely on the stack. Copying these values is quick an inexpensive, that means theres no reason we would want to prevent x from being valid. 

- Rust uses a special annotation called the Copy trait that we can place on types like integers that are stored on the stack.

- If a type has the Copy trait, then an older variable is still usable after assingment.

- Types that implement the Drop trait cannot be annotated with the Copy trait.

- Copy types:

1) All integer types
2) Boolean type
3) Floating point types
4) Character type
5) Tuples if they contain types that are also Copy. 

--- Ownership and functions --- 

- The same rules apply when passing values to functions. Passing a varible to a function will move or copy the value, just as assingment does. 

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so itâ€™s okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.


--- Return values and scope --- 

- Returning values can also transfer ownership: 

fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
  // moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// takes_and_gives_back will take a String and return one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}

*** Note: Taking and returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious, what if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? Its quite annoyning that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any dat resulting from the body of the function. In Rust, we can return multiple values using a tuple:


fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}

- This is too much work for such a common concept, which is why Rust has feature called refernces.
