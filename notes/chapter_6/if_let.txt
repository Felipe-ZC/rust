--- If_let syntax ---

- The if left syntax allows the programmer to handle match expression that
  only match to one pattern while ignoring the rest, consider the following code: 

let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
match some_u8_value {
    Some(3) => println!("three"),
    _ => (),
}

- The code above matches only one pattern and discards the rest. We can
  simplify this expression using the if let syntax: 

if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
    println!("three");
}

- If let takes a pttern and an expression separated by an equal sign. 

- The if let syntax is a faster way of expressing a specific type of match. We
  can think of the if let statement as syntactic sugar for a match expression
  that only matches one pattern and returns all other values.
