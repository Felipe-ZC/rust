--- Modules ---

- Modules are used to organize code within a crate into groups.
  They also control the privacy of items within a crate, that is,
  whether an item can be accessed outside its implementation. 

- Syntax: Used --lib keyword to create a new library: 

	cargo new --lib name

- We define a module by using the 'mod' keyword and specify the 
  name of the module. Inside modules we can have other modules,
  Modules can hold definitions for other items such as structs,
  enums, constants, traits functions etc.
