--- Separating modules into multiple files ---

- We can move the front_of_house module to its own file by changing the crate
  root file (src/lib.rs) so it contains the following code: 
 
    mod front_of_house;

    pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

-  This is what the definition for the front_of_house module in src/front_of_house.rs:

    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    } 

- Using a semicolon after mod front_of_house rather than using a block tells Rust to 
  load the module from another file.

  *** Note: File must have same name as module!

 - We can also move the hosting module to its own file as well using the same syntax:

   pub mod hosting;  // In src/front_of_house.rs

- Then we create a directory src/front_of_house and a file src/front_of_house/hosting.rs
  that will contain the definition for our hosting module:
 
   pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}

- The mode keyword declares modules, Rust looks for files with the same name as the module.
