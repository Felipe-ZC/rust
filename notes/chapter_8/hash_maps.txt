 --- Hash maps ---

- The hashmap type HashMap<K, V> stored a mapping of keys type K to values
  of type V. It performs this mapping via a hashing function, which determines
  how to place these key, value pairs in memory. 

- We can create new empty hash maps using the new method, elements can be added
  into the datat structure using insert:

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

- We need to 'use' the HashMap collection from standard library!

- Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap.  

- HashMaps are homogenous, all keys must of the same type and all values must
  be of the same type.

- Another way of constructing a hash map is to use the 'collect' method on a
  vector of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key and a value.

- The 'collect' method gathers data into a number of collection types. If we
  had two different vectors, one for keys and the other for values, we could
  use the zip method to create a vector of tuples where the first value of the
  first vector is paired with  the first value of the second vector and so forth.
  After running zip, we could use the collection method to turn that vector of
  tuples into a hashmap:

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let teams  = vec![String::from("Blue"), String::from("Yellow")];
    let initial_scores = vec![10, 50];

    let scores: HashMap<_, _> = teams.iter().zip(initial_scores.iter()).collect();

- Notice how we must the placehold type annotation in HashMap<_, _>, this is
  needed because its possible to collect into many different data structures and
  Rust doesn't know which one you want unless you specify. Rust can infer the types 
  that go into the hashmap based on the types of the values in the vector , so we 
  use the placeholder types. 

--- Ownership --- 

- Ownership of values in a hashmaps depends on the type. Types that implement
  the Copy trait, like i32  , are copied into the hash map. Owned values like
  'String' are moved into the hash map, the ownership of these values is
  transfered to the hash map:

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
    let field_value = String::from("Blue");

    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(field_name, field_value);
    // field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
    // see what compiler error you get!

- If we insert references to values in the hash map, the values won't be moved
  into the hash map. These values must be valid for at least as long as the hash
  map is valid. 

--- Accessing values in a hash map --- 

- We can access values in a hash map by providing its key to the 'get' method,
  as shown here:

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

    let team_name = String::from("Blue");
    let score = scores.get(&team_name);

- The get method returns an Option<&V> so score will contain the value
  Some(&10), if there is no value for that key in the hash map then get will
  return None. 

- We can use a for loop to iterate over each key, value pair:

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
