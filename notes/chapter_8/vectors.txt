--- Vectors --- 

- Vectrs are used to store values in a single data
  structure that puts all the values next to each
  other in memory.

- This collection is best used when you processing alist of items.

- To create a new vector:

    let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

- We must add a type annotation to empty vectors since it cannot deduce what
  type we wish to store in this vector. Rust can often infer the type of value 
  you want to store once you insert values. 

- Rust features a macro for creating a new vector based on the values you give it:

    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

--- Upading a vector --- 

- To insert elements into a vector we can use the insert method: 

    let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);

- If a vector is dropped (out of scope), all of the values it holds are also dropped.  

--- Reading vectors ---

- There are two ways of refering to a value stored inside a vector:
 
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &i32 = &v[2]; // Indexing
    println!("The third element is {}", third);

    // Get method
    match v.get(2) {
        Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
        None => println!("There is no third element."),
    }

- Remember borrowing rules! Consider the following code snippet that won't compile:

    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0];

    v.push(6);

    println!("The first element is: {}", first);

- When we try to run this code the compiler will complain about a borrowing a
  mutable that is also borrowed as immutable. 

- The code above looks like it should work, all we're doing is referencing the
  first the element in the vector so why should the program care about changes
  at the end of the vector?
